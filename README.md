# Final-Year-Project
Unusual Crowd Activity Detection
In this project, we propose a novel method for unusual human activity detection in crowded
scenes. 
Suspicious behavior is dangerous in public areas that may cause heavy causalities.
There are various systems developed on the basis of video frame acquisition where motion
or pedestrian detection occur but those systems are not intelligent enough to identify the
unusual activities even at real time. 
It is required to recognized scamper situation at
real time from video surveillance for quick and immediate management before any
casualties.
Proposed system focuses on recognizing suspicious activities and target to
achieve a technique which is able to detect suspicious activity automatically using
computer vision. 
Here system uses OpenCV library for classifying different kind of
actions at real time. The motion influence map has been used to represent the motion
analysis that frequently changes the position from one place to another. 
System uses CNN and YOLO algorithm for real-time object detection.
